### ***Problem Statement***

Vaccination is a cornerstone of public health, playing a critical role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. While vaccines offer individual protection through immunity and contribute to community-wide protection via herd immunity, there is limited understanding of the complex factors that influence vaccine uptake. These factors include socioeconomic status, behavioral patterns, demographic background, and individuals' perceptions and knowledge about both the illness and the vaccine itself.

Understanding how these factors interact to affect vaccine acceptance is essential for policymakers and public health officials. Insights into these influences can help inform the development of targeted interventions, communication strategies, and educational campaigns aimed at increasing vaccination coverage. Additionally, vaccine manufacturers can leverage this information to forecast demand more accurately and optimize production, particularly in response to outbreaks or pandemics.

Given the global importance of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases, this research aims to evaluate the influence of various factors on the uptake of vaccines, with a focus on seasonal flu vaccines. By exploring the socioeconomic, behavioral, and demographic factors, as well as individuals' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions towards flu vaccines, this study seeks to provide actionable insights that can guide policy and improve public health outcomes.

### ***Objectives***
This project aims to explore various factors influencing individuals' decisions to receive the seasonal flu vaccine. The following objectives are addressed:

1. **Socioeconomic Factors**  
   To examine the impact of socioeconomic factors on an individual's decision to receive the seasonal flu vaccine.

2. **Behavioral Factors**  
   To assess the role of behavioral factors in influencing an individual's choice to get the seasonal flu vaccine.

3. **Demographic Factors**  
   To investigate how demographic characteristics affect an individual's likelihood of receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.

4. **Knowledge, Perception, and Attitude**  
   To explore how an individual's understanding, views, and attitude towards the seasonal flu vaccine affect their decision to get vaccinated.


## **Data Understanding**

The datasets used in this project were obtained from Driven Data and originate from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). These datasets provide comprehensive information on the social, economic, and demographic backgrounds of the survey respondents, along with their opinions on the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. The data has been split into two parts: the training set features and the training set labels.
