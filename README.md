## **INTRODUCTION**

## **Business Understanding**

### ***Problem Statement***
In this project, I am tackling a predictive modeling problem related to the uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine. Specifically,trying to predict whether individuals will take the seasonal flu vaccine based on various features (such as demographics, socioeconomic factors, and behaviors).

The business issue here is to improve the vaccination rates within a population by identifying individuals who are likely to get vaccinated (or not). This is especially important for healthcare organizations, insurance companies, or public health initiatives aiming to increase vaccination coverage to reduce the spread of seasonal flu. By understanding the factors that contribute to vaccine uptake, organizations can create targeted interventions that encourage more individuals to get vaccinated, thereby improving public health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs related to flu-related illnesses.

## **Main Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate seasonal flu vaccine uptake

### ***Objectives***
This project aims to explore various factors influencing individuals' decisions to receive the seasonal flu vaccine. The following objectives are addressed:

1. **Socioeconomic Factors**  
   To examine the impact of socioeconomic factors on an individual's decision to receive the seasonal flu vaccine.

2. **Behavioral Factors**  
   To assess the role of behavioral factors in influencing an individual's choice to get the seasonal flu vaccine.

3. **Demographic Factors**  
   To investigate how demographic characteristics affect an individual's likelihood of receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.

4. **Knowledge, Perception, and Attitude**  
   To explore how an individual's understanding, views, and attitude towards the seasonal flu vaccine affect their decision to get vaccinated.


## **Data Understanding**

The datasets used in this project were obtained from Driven Data and originate from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). These datasets provide comprehensive information on the social, economic, and demographic backgrounds of the survey respondents, along with their opinions on the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. The data has been split into two parts: the training set features and the training set labels.
